CIS425 Mobile Development for Business
Here is an example of mobile application that i was created for my class CIS425. This app was designed to be a trading platform for users to buy or sell their music festival tickets. This appâ€™s database are being stored in Firebase (No SQL Database) and offer users to Sign Up and Sign in. It also allows users to post their tickets or buy available tickets. It is still under development but in the future, I will be adding more features such as Payment option, Delivery, Facebook authentication, and more.
